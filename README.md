io-wraps-usatoday-java
======================
v0.5 - Java wrapper for USA TODAY Census API (only Census on this
rev). This is an uncompiled Maven project -- so simple to build 
by importing into Eclipse as a Maven project. All Google 
dependences (network libraries, parsers, auth modules, etc.)
will be fetched during the build.

Requirements: Java, Maven
